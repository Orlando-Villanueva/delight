# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The smart encouragement system powered by `StreakStateService` is a key differentiator for Delight that goes far beyond basic streak counting. This intelligent system provides contextual, personalized messaging that adapts to user behavior, reading history, and time of day. Currently, this sophisticated feature is not prominently highlighted on the landing page, representing a missed opportunity to showcase what makes Delight unique compared to simple habit trackers. This enhancement will strategically position the smart encouragement system as a primary selling point to convert visitors who are looking for more than just basic tracking.
