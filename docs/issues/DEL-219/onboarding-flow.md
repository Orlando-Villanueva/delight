# Create onboarding flow to convert signups into active users

## Problem

49% of users (36 of 73) sign up but never log a single reading. They register, land on the dashboard, and never return. This is our biggest leak—half of all signups are lost before experiencing the app's core value.

## Current state

- User registers → lands on empty dashboard
- No onboarding exists
- No prompt to log first reading or pick a plan
- No follow-up if they don't take action
- No "quick win" moment to reinforce value

## Success criteria

- Reduce "never read" percentage from 49% to under 25%
- New users log their first reading within the first session

## Possible solutions (to be refined)

1. Post-registration redirect to "Log your first reading" instead of empty dashboard
2. Reading plan prompt during or after registration
3. First reading celebration (confetti, encouragement message)
4. 24-hour follow-up email for users who registered but haven't read
